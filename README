=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Deep;
    use Test::Mojo::WithRoles 'TestDeep';

    my $t = Test::Mojo->new( 'MyApp' );
    $t->get_ok( '/data.json' )
        ->json_deeply(
            superhashof( { foo => 'bar' } ),
            'has at least a foo key with "bar" value',
        );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds some L<Test::Deep> functionality to L<Test::Mojo>. C<Test::Deep>
allows for extremely-customizable testing of data structures.

=method json_deeply

    $t->cmp_deeply( $expect, $desc )
    $t->cmp_deeply( $ptr, $expect, $desc )

Test that the current response (parsed as a JSON object) matches the given
tests. C<$expect> is a data structure containing L<Test::Deep
comparisons|Test::Deep/SPECIAL COMPARISONS PROVIDED> to run. C<$desc> is a
description of the test.

If given, C<$ptr> is a JSON pointer string to pick out a single part of the
data structure. This is more convenient than using Test::Deep's comparison
routines to do the same thing. See L<Mojo::JSON::Pointer>.

Corresponds to L<cmp_deeply in Test::Deep|Test::Deep/COMPARISON FUNCTIONS>.
