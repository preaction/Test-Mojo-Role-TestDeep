=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Mojo::WithRoles 'TestDeep';

    my $t = Test::Mojo::WithRoles->new( 'MyApp' );

    # Test JSON responses with Test::Deep
    $t->get_ok( '/data.json' )
      ->json_deeply(
        superhashof( { foo => 'bar' } ),
        'has at least a foo key with "bar" value',
      );

    # Test HTML with Test::Deep
    $t->get_ok( '/index.html' )
      ->text_deeply(
        'nav a',
        [qw( Home Blog Projects About Contact )],
        'nav link text matches site section titles',
      )
      ->attr_deeply(
        'nav a',
        href => [qw( / /blog /projects /about /contact )],
        'nav link href matches site section URLs',

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds some L<Test::Deep> functionality to L<Test::Mojo>.
C<Test::Deep> allows for extremely-customizable testing of data
structures. This module adds some helper methods to C<Test::Mojo> (using
L<Test::Mojo::WithRoles>) to test your web app's responses using
C<Test::Deep>.

=method json_deeply

    $t->json_deeply( $expect, $desc )
    $t->json_deeply( $ptr, $expect, $desc )

Test that the current response (parsed as a JSON object) matches the given
tests. C<$expect> is a data structure containing L<Test::Deep
comparisons|Test::Deep/SPECIAL COMPARISONS PROVIDED> to run. C<$desc> is an
optional description of the test.

If given, C<$ptr> is a JSON pointer string to pick out a single part of the
data structure. This is more convenient than using Test::Deep's comparison
routines to do the same thing. See L<Mojo::JSON::Pointer>.

Corresponds to L<cmp_deeply in Test::Deep|Test::Deep/COMPARISON FUNCTIONS>.

=head2 text_deeply

    $t->text_deeply( $selector => $expect, $desc );

Test the text of the elements matched by the given C<$selector> against
the given test. C<$expect> is a data structure containing L<Test::Deep
comparisons|Test::Deep/SPECIAL COMPARISONS PROVIDED> to run. C<$desc> is
an optional description of the test.

The elements will always be an arrayref, even if only one
element matches.

For example:

    # test.html
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/blog">Blog</a></li>
            <li><a href="/projects">Projects</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    # test.t
    $t->get_ok( 'test.html' )
      ->text_deeply(
        'nav a' => [bag( Home Blog Projects )],
        'nav element text is correct',
      );

This is equivalent to:

    $t->get_ok( 'test.html' );
    my $dom = $t->tx->res->dom;
    cmp_deeply
        [ $dom->find( 'nav a' )->map( 'text' )->each ],
        [ bag( Home Blog Projects ) ],
        'nav element text is correct';

=head2 attr_deeply

    $t->attr_deeply( $selector, $attr => $expect, ..., $desc );

Test the given attributes of the elements matched by the given selector
against the given test. C<$expect> is a data structure containing
L<Test::Deep comparisons|Test::Deep/SPECIAL COMPARISONS PROVIDED> to
run. C<$desc> is an optional description of the test.

The element attributes will always be an arrayref, even if only one
element matches.

For example:

    # test.html
    <form action="/search" method="GET">
        ...
    </form>

    # test.t
    $t->get_ok( 'test.html' )
      ->attr_deeply(
        'form',
        action => [qw( /search )],
        method => [re( qr( get )i )],
        'form element is correct',
      );

This is equivalent to:

    $t->get_ok( 'test.html' );
    my $dom = $t->tx->res->dom;
    cmp_deeply
        [ $dom->find( 'form' )->map( attr => 'action' )->each ],
        [ qw( /search ) ],
        'form element action is correct',
        ;
    cmp_deeply
        [ $dom->find( 'form' )->map( attr => 'method' )->each ],
        [ re( qr( get )i ) ],
        'form element method is correct',
        ;
